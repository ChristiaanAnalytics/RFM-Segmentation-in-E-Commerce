# RFM-Segmentation-in-E-Commerce
This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and segments customers with K-Means clustering. The goal is to identify key customer groups—such as loyal, at-risk, and high-value customers—to support targeted marketing strategies in e-commerce.
